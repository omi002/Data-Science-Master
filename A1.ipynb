    "1. Who developed python programming language?\n",
    "  Ans- Guido van Rossum.\n",
    "2. Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "  Ans- object-oriented programming.\n",
    "3. is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "  Ans- Yes.\n",
    "4. what is the correct extension of the python file?\n",
    " Ans- .py\n",
    "5. Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    " Ans- first compiled and then interpreted.\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code use to define in python language?\n",
    " Ans- An opening curly bracket indicates the start of a block and a closing bracket indicates the end of the block. And all the code between the two is part of the block.\n",
    "7. state a character used to give single line comments in python?\n",

    "8. mention function which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    " Ans- The function sys.version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "9. python support the creation of anonymous function runtime, using a construct called?\n",

    " 14. how is memory managed in python? \n",
    "  Ans- As we know, Python uses the dynamic memory allocation which is managed by the Heap data structure. Memory Heap holds the objects and other data structures that will be used in the program. Python memory manager manages the allocation or de-allocation of the heap memory space through the API functions.\n",
    "15. how to install python on windows and set path variables?\n",
    " Ans- Direct go to website python.com.\n",
    "16. is indentation required in python?\n",
    " Ans- Indentation is a very important concept of Python because without proper indenting the Python code, you will end up seeing IndentationError and the code will not get compiled."
